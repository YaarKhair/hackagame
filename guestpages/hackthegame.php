							Welcome to the page of the legacy hacking game HackTheGame.<br>
							<br>
							This page is maintained for historical purposes. You can still download the old game here, but it's not longer updated.<br>
							<br>
							If you like hacking games, you might want to consider trying out my newest hacking game <a href="http://www.hackerforever.com">HackerForever</a>.

							In this game you play a hacker. When you first log in to your hacking console you get an email from someone you don't know, who asks you to do a hack for him because he heard great things about you. If you succeed, your name will become more known, and you will get more hacking assignments.<br>
							<br>
							The assignments get harder along the game. To help you in your hacking adventure, you have a full featured hacking toolbox. You have tools like: ping, portscan, telnet, virus uploader, password hacker, file destroyer, etc.<br>
							<br>
							The operating system used in the game is a mix of *NUX and MS-DOS/Windows, which I called ChaOs. It has some nice features, like a local filesystem (you can add your own folders), and much more cool stuff.
